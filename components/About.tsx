          Hey there, I'm Sahab. I love coding and pretty much any tech-related
          stuff 👨‍💻
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always enjoyed creating things and wanted to make my own video
          game, however, I had no idea where to start. For over 2 years I used
          my free time to learn programming languages and new technologies,
          algorithms and data structures through YouTube and online courses.
          During this period I also discovered a newfound love for web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm a second year Computer Science student at Monash
          University Malaysia.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>When I'm not coding</b> I'm probably gaming, watching anime, or
          working out 💪
